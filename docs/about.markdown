Hello,

My name is Anneliese and I’m an urbanist. My interest lies in urban analysis, more specifically in urban data analysis.

I have always advocated that in order to be able to properly plan cities, urbanists must first understand its systems.

These systems are becoming increasingly entangled and complex. Understanding them is a tricky and difficult task, but a fundamental one to achieve the social and spatial justice we are currently seeking.

The amount of data available today is an incredible source to that goal. I believe that urban data analysis can push forward the way cities are planned. It can bring light to overlooked issues, show unimaginable correlations, and bring forward new ways of thinking the urban environment.

I’m currently diving into the world of data as a way to improve myself as an urbanist. This blog just shows this path. It shows my findings along the difficulties, and errors embedded in it. I’m open to constructive criticism, questions, and inquiries. Feel free to get in touch or just follow along. I’ll be happy to have you around.

Cheers!
